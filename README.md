# Printing-management-system
SmartPrint System is a web app to reduce long queues in college stationery stores. Students upload documents for printing via the **Student Web App**, while storekeepers manage print jobs through the **Store Keeper Web App**. This system streamlines the process, improving efficiency and reducing waiting time. PostgreSQL is used for the database.
